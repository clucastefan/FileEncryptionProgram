# FileEncryptionProgram
This is my very first personal project. It's a basic encryption program in python with
a graphical user interface. It uses Tkinter library for the GUI and PyCrypto library for 
the encryption part. It works only on Linux File System.
# How to run the program 
>1. Make sure you have python installed on your system. Use the command python -V in the terminal
>2. Get the program using git clone command in the linux terminal. #git clone <replink>
>3. The program should download automatically in the downloads folder. You can move it to a certain folder
  using mv command. You need to make sure the program is in the folder where you want to encrypt the files.
>4. Run the program. python encrypt.py
>5. To decrypt a file you need to write the file's entire name
  
In time i will try and bring updates to make it even more interesting and also simpler. Thank you !
